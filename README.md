**OpenEmu for Apple Silicon** is a fork of **OpenEmu 2.4.1** optimized for Apple Silicon Macs. This project is born out of admiration for the original project and a personal will to experiment, tinker and run my favorite softwares faster, smoother, and more efficiently on my Mac. As a result, this build offers significant improvements in both speed and power resource consumption. 

This project demonstrates that OpenEmu can run natively on ARM architecture without rewriting its whole codebase, showcasing the potential for further optimizations going further.

## What's New

- **New Icon** based on the original OpenEmu icon.
- **Significant Faster Launch Times** from my own experience compared with the Intel based officiel OpenEmu build. 
- **Enhanced Performance:** Reduced battery and resource consumption, ensuring a smoother and more efficient gaming experience.
- **Proof of Concept:** Demonstrates that OpenEmu can run natively on ARM architecture and Apple Silicon chips, paving the way for future optimizations and developments.

## How to use

- Downnload the latest release of OpenEmu for Apple Silicon 
- Copy OpenEmu.app to ~/Applications
- Download your favorite Cores or the All-in-One pack from the Releases page
- Go to ~/Library/Application Support/OpenEmu/Cores and place your Core(s) there.
  The ~/Library folder is located in the root of you Macintosh HD partition. You can display hidden folders with ⌘+Shift+;

## Known Issues

Currently all OpenEmu cores work perfectly except :

* Atari 5200
* Sony PSP 
* GameCube 
* Nintendo DS 

Cores needs to be places manually in ~/Library/Application Support/OpenEmu/Cores

OpenEmu may crash when you stop an emulation, but don’t worry—it relaucnhes so fast, you’ll barely have time to blink. (I'm so proud of this achieved speed)

## Contributing

Contributions from anyone interested in enhancing OpenEmu on Apple Silicon is welcomed! If encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to open a [pull request]((https://github.com/Azyzraissi/OpenEmu/pulls)) and help upgrade this build.
I am not an advanced developer and I made this build out of passion and curiosity.
A huge shoutout to my friend [Adam Solloway](https://github.com/a-soll), who believed in me from the start and had complete confidence that I could bring this build to life—despite my complete lack of Swift or Xcode knowledge.
